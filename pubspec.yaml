  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  #assets:


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  # - family: Montserrat
  #   fonts:
  #     - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
  #     - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Italic.ttf
  #       weight: 700
  - family: Almarai
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Almarai-Regular.ttf
        weight: 700
  # - family: Amiri
  #   fonts:
  #     - asset: fonts/Amiri-Regular.ttf
  #       weight: 700
  # - family: LexendZetta
  #   fonts:
  #     - asset: fonts/LexendZetta-Regular.ttf
  #       weight: 700
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
